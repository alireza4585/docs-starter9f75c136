Docuo has a unique take on configurations. We encourage you to congregate information about your site into one place. We guard the fields of this file and facilitate making this data object accessible across your site.

Keeping a well-maintained `docuo.config.json` helps you, your collaborators, and your open source contributors to be able to focus on documentation while still being able to customize the site.

## Syntax to declare `docuo.config.json`

## What goes into a `docuo.config.json`?

The high-level overview of Docuo configuration can be categorized into:

- [Site metadata](./Configuration.mdx#site-metadata)
- [Theme configurations](./Configuration.mdx#theme-configurations)

### Site metadata

Site metadata contains the essential global metadata such as `title` and `favicon`.

They are used in several places such as your site's title and headings, browser tab icon, social sharing (Facebook, Twitter) information.

It is recommended to check the [sitemeta docs](../Customizing/Customize%20with%20json%20file.mdx#title) for more information.

### Theme configurations

Theme config includes all the configurations needed to generate site themes, mainly including layout and site style.

To set the layout, `navbar` and `footer`  can control the layout of header navbar and site footer items. You can also set the group display of your documentation using `anchors `and `tabs`

Check [Theme Customization](../Customizing/Customize%20with%20json%20file.mdx#themeconfig) for more information.
