*If your requested subdomain is taken, you'll get an error message. Please email **mailto:docuo@spreading.ai** to check if it is an active account, or if we can free up the subdomain for you.*

## Visit your first project website

Once you've successfully set up your project, you will enter your project homepage. You can see the basic information of your project on the homepage, including project name, associated Github repository, site link and site preview page. The website is in publishing status when you first enter the homepage, which will take 1-2 minutes.

After the site is successfully published, you can click the site link on the homepage to access your initialization docs website built from the template repository content.
